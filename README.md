College Admission Agent (RAG-Based AI)

Overview

The College Admission Agent is an AI-powered assistant built using IBM Watsonx.ai and Granite Foundation Models. It is designed to streamline and simplify the student admission process by answering queries about eligibility criteria, fee structure, important dates, and application procedures. This project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve data from uploaded documents and generate accurate, real-time responses without coding.
